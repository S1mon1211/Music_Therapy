# Effect of Music Therapy on Mental Health
@Simon_Hua

## Project Overview
### Introduction
  Musicâ€™s role in mental health remains a compelling yet debated topic. While studies suggest music can alleviate stress and mood disorders, the impact of specific genres on mental conditionsâ€”such as anxiety, depression, and insomniaâ€”is unclear. Conflicting theories persist: some emphasize engagement intensity over genre, while others link certain styles (e.g., classical, gospel) to therapeutic effects. Leveraging a dataset of 736 respondents, this study investigates three dimensions: 
  
  (1) Correlations between listening habits (frequency, context) and mental health scores;
  
  (2) Mutual effects of 16 music genres and 4 mental health problems (Gospelâ€™s anxiety-reducing potential vs. Lofiâ€™s depressive associations);
  
  (3) Personalized genre recommendations for mental health support.
  
  By bridging data-driven analysis with music therapy principles, this research aims to inform clinical practices and optimize music platformsâ€™ therapeutic potential through context-aware, personalized interventions.

### Goal
  - Investigate the relationship between different music-listening habits and mental conditions
  - Explore whether the preferred music genres postively or negatively affect mental state
  - Identify music genres that should be recommended for healing specific types of mental problems (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)

### Dataset
  - Description: 736 data points from a public mental health survey, with respondents from diverse age ranges and regions.
  - Survey Structure:
      - Part 1: General background questions about the responders and their music habits.
      - Part 2: Frequency of listening to given music genres.
      - Part 3: Mental Health conditions
