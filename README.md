# Effect of Music Therapy on Mental Health
@Simon_Hua

## Project Overview
### Introduction
  Music’s role in mental health remains a compelling yet debated topic. While studies suggest music can alleviate stress and mood disorders, the impact of specific genres on mental conditions—such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia—is unclear. Conflicting theories persist: some emphasize engagement intensity over genre, while others link certain styles (e.g., classical, gospel) to therapeutic effects. Leveraging a dataset of 736 respondents, this study investigates three dimensions: 
  
  (1) Correlations between listening habits (frequency, context) and mental health scores;
  
  (2) Mutual effects of 16 music genres and 4 mental health problems (Gospel’s anxiety-reducing potential vs. Lofi’s depressive associations);
  
  (3) Personalized genre recommendations for mental health support.
  
  By bridging data-driven analysis with music therapy principles, this research aims to inform clinical practices and optimize music platforms’ therapeutic potential through context-aware, personalized interventions. 

### Goal
  - Investigate the relationship between different music-listening habits and mental conditions
  - Explore whether the preferred music genres postively or negatively affect mental state
  - Identify music genres that should be recommended for healing specific types of mental problems (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)

### Dataset
  - Description: 736 data points from a public mental health survey, with respondents from diverse age ranges and regions.
  - Survey Structure:
      - Part 1: General background questions about the responders and their music habits.
      - Part 2: Frequency of listening to given music genres.
      - Part 3: Mental Health conditions
