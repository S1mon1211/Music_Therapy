# Effect of Music Therapy on Mental Health
@Simon_Hua


## Project Overview
### Introduction
  Musicâ€™s role in mental health remains a compelling yet debated topic. While studies suggest music can alleviate stress and mood disorders, the impact of specific genres on mental conditionsâ€”such as anxiety, depression, and insomniaâ€”is unclear. Conflicting theories persist: some emphasize engagement intensity over genre, while others link certain styles (e.g., classical, gospel) to therapeutic effects. Leveraging a dataset of 736 respondents, this study investigates three dimensions: 
  
  - Correlations between listening habits (frequency, context) and mental health scores;
  
  - Mutual effects of 16 music genres and 4 mental health problems (Gospelâ€™s anxiety-reducing potential vs. Lofiâ€™s depressive associations);
  
  - Personalized genre recommendations for mental health support.
  
  By bridging data-driven analysis with music therapy principles, this research aims to inform clinical practices and optimize music platformsâ€™ therapeutic potential through context-aware, personalized interventions.

### Goal
  - Investigate the relationship between different music-listening habits and mental conditions
  - Explore whether the preferred music genres postively or negatively affect mental state
  - Identify music genres that should be recommended for healing specific types of mental problems (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)

### Dataset
  - Description: 736 data points from a public mental health survey, with respondents from diverse age ranges and regions.
  - Survey Structure:
      - Part 1: General background questions about the responders and their music habits.
      - Part 2: Frequency of listening to given music genres.
      - Part 3: Mental Health conditions

## Key Findings
### Listening Habits And Mental Health

</p>

#### Findings:
As the responders in this survey are mostly 14-35 year-old young people, so they seem to prefer fast-paced music genres(Rock: 25.5%, Pop: 15.7% and Metal: 12.1%), which may impact their mental conditions.

</p>

#### Findings:
Obvious variations could be identified in the listening frequency for each genre (Rock and pop are more popular than Gospel and Latin).

</p>

#### Findings:
Different genres may attract specific age groups, which indicates that certain music therapy could be proposed to targeted groups.

### Music Genres And Mental Health

</p>

#### Findings:
After defining three intensity levels(1-3: mild, 4-7: moderate, 8-10: severe), we compared among genres by mental problem.
- For Anxiety, **folk and pop** listeners have obviously higher intensity (75% above level 6), while **gospel** listeners are less likely to have anxiety (75% below level 6).
- For depression, **lofi** listeners have severe depression intensity (50% above level 8), while **gospel** listeners seem to have smaller possibility to be depressed (75% below level 4).
- For insomnia, latin fans have lower insomnia intensity (all of which below level 1) and no specific genres seem to result in high intensity.
- For OCD, music therapy exhibits almost no effect on it.

#### Findings:
We examined therapy effects for each of four mental disorders and here is an example on anxiety. For more details, go check [**Data Analysis Notebook**](https://github.com/S1mon1211/Music_Therapy/blob/main/Data_Analysis_on_Music_Therapy_Effect.ipynb).
